                <p>Have you ever tried to sell or giveaway something on the internet? Of course you have.</p>
                
                <p>Have you had multiple people say "I WANT IT!" and then they just disappear? Everyone has.</p>
                
                <p>But what if you could post something for sale or make available, then keep a list of people who have asked about it or want it? Then, if the first person doesn't follow through, it can go to the next person.</p>

                <p>That's what we're doing. Welcome to ClaimIt.</p>
